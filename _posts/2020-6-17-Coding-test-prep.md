I can almost say coding test is all you need to get a job as a junior software engineer because if you don't pass the coding test, you are not given a chance for an interview at all. 
I have also experience many failures due to my lacking experience with coding test problems. 
I have planned to solve at least one coding problem per day but it has not been easy. 
Then, I thought let's give myself a moderate pressure to study coding problems. And that is participating coding competitions.
