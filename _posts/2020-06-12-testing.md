## Features
### Auto-Generating Sitemap
The sitemap is auto generated! Just simply change the front matter of each site. It looks like so...
```
sitemap:
    priority: 0.7
    lastmod: 2017-11-02
    changefreq: weekly
```
### Formspring integration
The contact form below each page on the footer actually collects information! Just change your email address in the ```_config.yml``` file!
