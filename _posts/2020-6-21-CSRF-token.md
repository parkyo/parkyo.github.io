### CSRF Token
<strong>Cross-site Request Forgery token</strong> is a token containing a random value generated by the server-side application in order to prevent hackers from forging the user's data.

When a client logs in, the server gives a session token unique to that client. The client needs to provide the same token in order to request to the server so that the server validates it.
